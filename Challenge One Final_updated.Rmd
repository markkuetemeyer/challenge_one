#### 1. General overview of the data

**Machines:**                                                                                                           
**a. How many machines are there?**
```{r}
print(uniqueN(machine$machine))
```


**b. What percentage of them are small?**
```{r}
small = machine[,.(.N), by=small_machine][small_machine == 1, N]
big = machine[,.(.N), by=small_machine][small_machine == 0, N]

perc_small = round((small/(small+big))*100)
print(paste0(perc_small," %"))
```



**c. How do they distribute in terms of location type i.e. transport, petrol station?**
```{r} 
distribution = machine[,.(.N), by=location_type ]
distribution$percantage = round((distribution$N/sum(distribution$N))*100,digits = 2)
distribution
```

**Products:**                                                              
**d. How many products are there? Which category has the highest number of products?**
```{r}
uniqueN(product$product_name)
product[, .(count = .N), by = category][count == max(count), category]
```

**e. Which category has the highest and lowest average price? And within snacks or drinks?**
```{r}
product[, .(avg_price = mean(price)), by = category][avg_price == max(avg_price)| avg_price == min(avg_price),category]

product[type_drink_snack == "snack", .(avg_price = mean(price)), by = category][avg_price == max(avg_price)| avg_price == min(avg_price),category]

product[type_drink_snack == "drink", .(avg_price = mean(price)), by = category][avg_price == max(avg_price)| avg_price == min(avg_price),category]
```

                                                                                                                                                                         
**Transactional data:**                                                                                                
**f. Restricting the transactional data to March 2017, what’s the average daily items among small and big machines? **      
**Why do you think there is such a difference? Give at least 2 possible reasons.**
```{r}
merged_DT_all <- merge(merge(transaction, product, 
                             by.x = "product_name", 
                             by.y = "product_name", 
                             all.x = T), 
                       machine,
                       by.x = "machine",
                       by.y = "machine",
                       all.x = T)

merged_DT_all[month(date) == 3, .(daily_item = .N / uniqueN(date)), by = small_machine]
```
**Answer:** 

----------

#### 2. Consider the following plot of the number of items sold per machine and day
![Plot.](plot.png)
**a. Is there a general trend in the number of snacks and drinks as the months progress from January to April? **
**Is it the same for snacks and drinks? Why do you think that might be so?**

**Answer:** Based on the graphic we can observe that for the period between January to April, 
the average consumption of snacks remains stable, while the average consumption of drinks shows a tendency to increase. 
This may occur due to a shift in seasons (higher temperatures lead to higher consumption of beverages). 



**b. Is there shorter time period trend as well? Is it the same for snacks and drinks? What do you think might be the cause?**                                                                                                                

**Answer:** The graphic also shows short time period trends that show peaks and valleys for one vending machine. 
Given that these match between snacks and drinks, we can assume that they happen due to the refill nature 
of a vending machine: the peaks generate when consumption increases when the machine has just been refilled 
because it has more variety of products to offer, and viceversa. Another cause might be the demand peaks on weekends and demand lows on Mondays. Hoewever, we need to have a better look an the data to support the second hypothesis.               
##I added the second Option. Happy to discuss!


----------

#### 3. Given the following distribution of average income:
```{r}
summary(machine$income_average)
```


**a) Are there outliers? How would you treat them? Provide code with your answer**
```{r}
summary(machine$income_average)
```
**Answer:** Yes, there are outliers in the income_average. By looking to the median which is 53,777 and the 3rd Quartile that is 60148, we notice the max value ( 14281500) is extremely high compared to this percentilence. Hence, we can affirm that there are outliers.

```{r}
plot(machine$income_average)
abline(h=53777, col="green" )
abline(h=60148,col="blue")
abline(h=48595, col='blue')
```

**Answer:** The existence of outliers could also have been checked by ploting the income_average's observations. As it is shown in the plot, the majority of the observations form a straight line at the bottom. However, there are some observations that deviate by a large distance from this trend. These are the outliners. The values of these outliners are probably incorrect since it's not expected that a single vending machine has an income of million of dollars. Giving this hypothesis, we chose to remove all of those that show a income_average of more than 1000000 dollars.

```{r}
machine <- machine[income_average < 2000000,]
```

**b) Can you give three possibilities on how to treat the NA cases? Which option you choose and why? 
Provide code with your answer**

```{r}
map(machine, ~sum(is.na(.)))

#1st Option - Remove the NA's
machine_dropna <- na.omit(machine)

#2nd Option - Substitute the NA's with mean/median/mode of the variable
machine$train_AvgDailyPAssengers[which(is.na(machine$train_AvgDailyPassengers))] <- median(machine$train_AvgDailyPassengers)

machine$train_AvgWorkingDayPassengers[which(is.na(machine$train_AvgWorkingDayPassengers))] <- median(machine$train_AvgWorkingDayPassengers)

machine$income_average[which(is.na(machine$income_average))] <- median(machine$income_average)

machine$total_number_of_routes_600[which(is.na(machine$total_number_of_routes_600))] <- median(machine$total_number_of_routes_600)

```

The last step is to take care of the categorical data. 
So we can replace the NA in location_type for the mode which is transport
```{r}
table(machine$location_type)
machine$location_type[which(is.na(machine$location_type))] <- 'transport'
```

 
-------- This code did not work for me? -----------
```{r}
#3rd Option - Replace the NA's by predictions of K-nearest Neighbors
library(VIM)
machine_dataKNN <- kNN(machine)
machine_data <- subset(machine_dataKNN, select = machine : small_machine)
machine_data
```

The best options for this specific dataset are the 2nd and the 3rd options, since almost half of the observation contain NA values. If we use the 1st method and drop these observations we loose a significant part of the data.

Regarding the 2nd and the 3rd method, although replacing the NA values by median/mean is the easiest option we believe that this method can bring us problems of skewedness towards the mean, and can lead us to false conclusions. Giving this we opted for the 3rd method.

----------

#### 4. According to the following boxplot, what is the median number of hotels in the machine area?
```{r}
boxplot(machine$num_hotels, data = data, ylim = c(0,2))
summary(machine$num_hotels)
```
**Answer:** The median number of hotels in the machine area is 0.                                                                              
Maybe we should write 1-2 Sentences on what this Fact could have for implications?? I do not think this question was asked just to see if we can find the right median. What do you think? Happy to disuss.
          

-----------
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
#### 5. In this exercise we will build a location score that tells us what’s the average daily items per machine depending on the location it is placed. This model could be used to
a) Decide in which locations to place new machines 
b) Construct a benchmark for each machine: how much should it sell according to its location? 
This can be used to detect problems in machines (i.e. illumination, bad placement within a station etc.)

For that, you will build a linear model to predict machine daily items using the following
features:
  1. Machine size (big or small)
  2. Income of the area
  3. Number of routes in the area
  4. Number of hotels with 4 and 5 stars in the area
  5. 0-1 Indicator of whether the machine has train_AvgDailyPassengers informed meaning it is a petrol station or other type      of location
  6. Number of other Vendex machines in the area


**a. Do all variables show statistical significance? Which ones doesn’t? How do you know?**
```{r}
daily_item <- transaction[, .(daily_item = .N/ uniqueN(date)), by = machine]
machine <- merge(machine, daily_item, by = "machine")
target_DT <- machine[, .(income_average, daily_item)]

names(machine)
machine[, petrol_station:=ifelse(is.na(train_AvgDailyPassengers), 1, 0)]
train <- machine[complete.cases(daily_item, 
                               small_machine, 
                               income_average, 
                               total_number_of_routes_600, 
                               num_hotels_45, 
                               petrol_station, 
                               n_density_5km, 
                               num_vendex_nearby_300),]
m0 <- glm(daily_item ~ small_machine + income_average + total_number_of_routes_600 +
            num_hotels_45 + petrol_station + n_density_5km + num_vendex_nearby_300, data = train)
summary(m0)
```
**Answer:** Not all variables show statistical significance. As we can see in the coefficient column in the summary,
Only "samll_machine", "income_average", "number_hotel_45", and "train" show significance, 
while "total_number_of_routes_600", "n_density_5km", and "num_vendex_nearby_300" do not.
**Does this change if the drop all the NA with Knn in Number 3 where the code did not work for me? **


**b. Build another linear model but this time instead of using the variables “total_number_of_routes_600 use **
**the log of that variable in base 10 calling it “log_transport”. Does this new variable show statistical significance?**
```{r}
machine[, log_transport:= log10(total_number_of_routes_600)]
train <- machine[complete.cases(daily_item, 
                               small_machine, 
                               income_average, 
                               log_transport, 
                               num_hotels_45, 
                               petrol_station, 
                               n_density_5km, 
                               num_vendex_nearby_300),]
m1 <- glm(daily_item ~ small_machine + income_average + log_transport +
            num_hotels_45 + petrol_station + n_density_5km + num_vendex_nearby_300, data = train)
summary(m1)
```
**Answer:** Yes, it does show significance.


**Train the model constructed in the previous question (b) removing the variables that do NOT show statistical significance calling it final_model and with that model answer the following questions**
```{r}
train <- machine[complete.cases(daily_item, 
                               small_machine, 
                               income_average, 
                               log_transport, 
                               num_hotels_45, 
                               petrol_station,  
                               num_vendex_nearby_300),]
final_model <- glm(daily_item ~ small_machine + income_average + log_transport +
                     num_hotels_45 + petrol_station + num_vendex_nearby_300, data = train)
summary(final_model)
```
When do we say that a Variable is significant or not? I do not see on what criteria we chose which variables should stay or not.



**c. How many daily items less do small machines sell all other factors remaining equal?**
```{r}
cof <- summary(final_model)$coefficients
cof["small_machine", "Estimate"]
```

**d. What’s effect on machine sales does having other nearby machines all other factors remaining equal?**
```{r}
cof["num_vendex_nearby_300", "Estimate"]
```


**e. Ranking all machines according to the final_model, what are the real daily sales of the top 20% machines **
**with respect to your model prediction? And the real daily sales of the bottom 20% machines **
**according to your model? What’s the top20%/bottom20% ratio?**
```{r}
outcome <- predict(final_model)
top_20_pct <- outcome[outcome > quantile(outcome, .8)]
bottom_20_pct <- outcome[outcome < quantile(outcome, .2)]
top_bottom_ratio <- mean(top_20_pct / bottom_20_pct)
top_bottom_ratio
```
**Answer:** The values of top 20% and bottom 20% are stored in the vectors provided above.
The average ratio of top 20% devided by bottom 20% should is 2.252792
----- There is a discrepancy between the code output and the answer. Why is that? -----


**f. Given the following 2 locations for a big machine:**                                                                                
        i.  Supermarket entrance, 2 nearby hotels of 4 stars, 20 transport routes, no
        nearby machines                                                                                                                
        ii. Transport station, no nearby hotels of 4 or 5 stars, 10 transport routes nearby,                                                                3 nearby Vendex machines                                                                                                                  
**Which location would you choose and why?**

```{r}
unique(machine$location_type)
loc_1 <- data.table("small_machine" = 0, 
                    "income_average" = 0, 
                    "log_transport" = log10(20),
                    "num_hotels_45" = 2, 
                    "petrol_station" = 0, 
                    "num_vendex_nearby_300" = 0)
loc_2 <- data.table("small_machine" = 0, 
                    "income_average" = 0, 
                    "log_transport" = log10(10),
                    "num_hotels_45" = 0, 
                    "petrol_station" = 1, 
                    "num_vendex_nearby_300" = 3)
pred_loc_1 <- predict(final_model, newdata = loc_1, type = "response")
pred_loc_2 <- predict(final_model, newdata = loc_2, type = "response")
pred_loc_1 > pred_loc_2

pred_table <- data.table(c(1,2),c(pred_loc_1,pred_loc_2))
pred_table
```
**Answer:** Choose the first location, since it has better predictive outcome.


Note: Since the estimated coefficient of income_average is infinitesimal, we can put whatever number we want and won't affect the outcome much. Choose the first location, since it has better predictive outcome.
(why is income_avrg an infinitesmal?)


---------- Recommendations -------------                                                                                                     
I just reread Evaluation, the recommendation must be implemented in the presentation, I dont think for this Challenge it is necessary. What do you think?
